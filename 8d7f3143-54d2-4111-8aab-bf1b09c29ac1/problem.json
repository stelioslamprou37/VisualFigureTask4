  "description": "Recreation of a Gene Ontology enrichment analysis horizontal bar chart showing significantly enriched terms across three categories: Biological Process (BP), Cellular Component (CC), and Molecular Function (MF). The visualization uses -log10(p-value) on the x-axis and color-codes bars by q-value (FDR-adjusted p-value) using a blue-to-red gradient.",
